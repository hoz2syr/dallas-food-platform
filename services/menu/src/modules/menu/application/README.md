# Menu Application Layer

This folder contains the application layer skeleton for the Menu service.

Purpose
- Hold use-cases, commands, and application orchestration code. The application layer coordinates domain objects and implements business workflows without performing side effects.

Notes
- Persistence and HTTP adapters will be added in the infrastructure layer later.
- No framework or transport-specific code should be introduced here.
