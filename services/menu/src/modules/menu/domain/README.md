# Menu Domain

This folder contains the domain model for the Menu service.

Purpose
- Define the core domain concepts for menu management (aggregate roots, value objects, domain events, and domain errors).

Notes
- This is a structural skeleton — behavior (methods, use-cases) will be added later in subsequent steps.
- No persistence, framework, or transport-specific code should be added here.
